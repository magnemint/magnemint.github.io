              The cerebellum, located at the back of the brain in the posterior
              cranial fossa, plays a vital role in maintaining balance,
              <b>coordinating precise movements</b>, and
              <b>contributing to cognitive functions</b> like language,
              learning, memory, and emotional processing. <br /><br />
              The cerebellum changes during adolescence in many different ways.
              Firstly, in a physical aspect, follows an
              <b>inverted U-shape trajectory</b>, initially growing its total
              volume larger until hitting a peak, then shrinking. This growth
              will most likely be described as an increase in <b>myelin</b>,
              improving the speed and accuracy of
              <b>neuron communication within the cerebellum</b>, leading to
              better motor skills and cognitive function. Males have been
              observed to typically have a larger total cerebellar volume that
              females at <b>~1160 mL</b> compared to <b>~1020 mL</b>, on
              average. But, females tend to mature quicker than males at
              <b>13 ¼ years</b> as apposed to <b>16 ½ years</b>. Different parts
              of the cerebellum mature <b>differently</b> at different ages and
              different sexes. <br /><br />
              <span class="list-terms"
                ><b>⋅</b> The inferior posterior lobe in females will decrease
                in volume much more than in males.</span
              ><br /><br />
              <span class="list-terms"
                ><b>⋅</b> The superior posterior lobe in males will tend to grow
                more and females will stay mostly stable though subtly
                increasing in volume.</span
              ><br /><br />
              <span class="list-terms"
                ><b>⋅</b> The anterior lobe in females will increase less and
                decrease more compared to males.</span
              ><br /><br />
              <span class="list-terms"
                ><b>⋅</b> The corpus medullare in males will not decrease in
                volume, compared to females who will eventually stop growing and
                lose volume.</span
              ><br /><br />
              <span class="list-terms"
                ><b>⋅</b> The vermis in both sexes will never stop losing
                volume.</span
              ><br /><br />
              But, in terms of cerebellar processing, fMRI studies have revealed
              changes in <b>cerebellar activation patterns</b> during cognitive
              tasks all throughout adolescence. These changes indicate ongoing
              <b>refinement</b> and <b>specialisation</b> of various neural
              circutis, including those in the cerebellum involved in various
              cognitive processes. This means that the cerebellum is
              <b>constantly adapting and specialising</b> its function in
              response to cognitive demand. <br /><br />
              <b>Synaptic pruning</b> is also common in adolescecne, where
              unused connections are <b>eliminated</b> and important/nessecary
              ones are <b>strengthened</b> (this process occurs all across the
              brain and not just the cerebellum). Synaptic pruning can result
              with move precise, efficent and refined movements, as well as
              faster processing of cognitive funcitons. <br /><br />
              The cerebellum also changes how it communicates with other brain
              regions during adolescence. One study looked into this and found
              that 8% of connections demonstrated decreased structural
              connectivity, while 6% showed increased structural connectivity.

          <h1>The Amygdala</h1>
          <p id="body-paragraphs">
            The amygdala is a key structure in the brain's limbic system located
            in the medial temporal lobe (just in front of the hippocampus),
            playing a crucial role in processing emotions, particularly fear and
            aggression. It is also important in the processes of emotional
            memory formation, social interactions and decision making linked to
            emotions.
            <br /><br />
            One major change that occurs during adolescence is the surge of
            hormones (such as estrogen and androgens/testostrone, a.k.a sex
            steroids) that directly affect the amygdala, possibly leading to a
            heightened emotional response. Adolescents may feel emotions more
            intensely, both positive and negative. Eventually, as an individual
            reaches the late stage of adolescence, they start to modulate their
            emotional responses and regulate their behaviour in social and
            emotional contexts.
            <br /><br />
            Adolescent development on the amygdala will see an increase in risk
            taking and sensation-seeking behaviour. The amygdala's role in
            processing reward-related stimuli and assessing potential risks
            contributes to adolescents' propensity for engaing in novel and
            sometimes risky behaviours. Numerous studies, including one
            conducted/funded/carried out by the
            <a
              href="https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/The-Teen-Brain-Behavior-Problem-Solving-and-Decision-Making-095.aspx"
              >AACAP</a
            >
            explains that since adolescents' prefrontal cortex is still
            developing, their actions are guided more by the emotional and
            reactive amygdala.<br /><br />The amygdala also explains why
            adolescents get more mood swings and have certain difficulty with
            conflict resolution.<br /><br />Physically, the amygdala develops
            more axons and more white matter grows in it, as well as
            experiencing a 40% volumetric growth. The amygdala is also subject
            to synaptic pruning and myelination.<br /><br /><br />Thank you :)

                The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a superstar of the brain, playing
                a critical role in those complex cognitive functions that set
                humans apart. Its main functions include executive functions
                such as planning, problem-solving, reasoning, and
                decision-making. It is also involved in working memory
                processes, such as maintaing information in mind while
                performing other mental operations, as well as inhibiting
                innappropriate or impulsive behaviours, directing and sustaining
                attention, regulating emotions and emotional responses,
                personality, planning/coordinating motor movements and higher
                cognitive functions (essentially self-control and
                concentration).
                <br /><br />
                The PFC is largely formed by childhood and adolescence is when
                it undergoes significant refinement. Its like a building under
                construction; the basic structure is there, but the finer
                details and internal wirings are still being worked on. Synaptic
                pruning and myelination also occur in the PFC. However, the PFC
                doesn't grow with the rest of the brain... It lags behind. This
                is why teens might excel at memorization (which mainly relies on
                the hippocampus) but struggle to plan and control their
                impulses. This explains why the amygdala is so dominant in
                adolescent years, since the PFC isn't fully developed yet,
                emotions can often hijack decision-making in teens, leading to
                impulsive behavior or risky choices. It is also known as the
                "personality center".
                <br /><br />
                The prefrontal cortex, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal
                cortex (DLPFC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC),
                undergoes continued development during adolescence. This
                development is characterized by increases in gray matter volume,
                dendritic arborization, and synaptic density, contributing to
                improved cognitive abilities such as decision-making, impulse
                control, and planning.

      <h2 class="p1 hide">Being at the front of your brain and occupying about ⅓ of your cerebral hemisphere. It is known for intellectual processing, emotional information processing, aggression regulation, judgement and decision-making. It is primarily associated with higher cognitive functions and voluntary movement control. It encompasses several key areas responsible for essential aspects of human behavior and cognition. These include executive functions like planning, decision-making, problem-solving, and reasoning. Additionally, the frontal lobe houses the primary motor cortex, which controls voluntary muscle movements, and Broca's area, crucial for speech production.</h2>
      <h2 class="p2 hide">Synaptic Pruning and Myelination obviously occurs, but there is also a gradual improvement in executive functions such as problem solving. The frontal lobe contributes to processes related to self-awareness and identity formation. Adolescents undergo significant changes in self-concept, values, and aspirations as they explore different roles and identities, influenced by both internal factors and external experiences.</h2>
      <h2 class="p3 hide">Neurons (gray matter) and synapses (junctions between neurons) proliferate in the cerebral cortex and are then gradually pruned throughout adolescence. Eventually, more than 40% of all synapses are eliminated, largely in the frontal lobes.</h2>
