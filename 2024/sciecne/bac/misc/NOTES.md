# Adolescence in the Human Brain

## Cerebellum

The cerebellum is responsible for maintaining balance, posture, and precise movements, as well as cognitive functions such as language, learning, memory and emotional processing.

The cerebellum develops during adolescence in many different ways. Firstly, in a physical aspect, according to a study conducted by [Henning Tiemeier](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775156/), the cerebellum's total volume physically becomes larger, but follows an inverted U-shape trajectory *(growing larger, then after hitting peak growing smaller)*, most likely due to ongoing myelination and synaptic pruning processes. Males typically have a larger total cerebellar volume that females at ~1160 mL (*males*) and ~1020 mL (*females*) on **average**. Females tend to mature quicker than males at 13 ¼ years as apposed to 16 ½ years. Different parts of the cerebellum mature differently at different ages and different sexes.

An increase in myelin can improve the speed and accuracy of communication within the cerebellum, leading to better motor skills and cognitive performance. 

```
The inferior posterior lobe in females will decrease in volume much more than in males.

```
The superior posterior lobe in males will tend to grow more and females will stay mostly stable though subtly increasing in volume.
```

```
The anterior lobe in females will increase less and decrease more compared to males.
```

```
The corpus medullare in males will not decrease in volume, compared to females who will eventually stop growing and lose volume
```
```
The vermis in both sexes will never stop losing volume

***But***, in terms of cerebellar processing, [fMRI studies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12311-011-0260-7) *(functional magnetic resonance imaging)* have revealed changes in cerebellar activation patterns during cognitive tasks all throughout adolescence. These changes indicate ongoing refinement and specialisation of various nerual circuits, including those in the cerebellum involved in various cognitive processes. This means that the cerebellum is constantly adapting and specialising its function in response to cognitive demand. 

[Synaptic pruning](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/synaptic-pruning) is also common in adolescecne, where unused connections are eliminated and important/nessecary ones are strengthened (this process occurs all across the brain and not just the cerebellum). Synaptic pruning can result with move precise, efficent and refined movements, as well as faster processing of cognitive funcitons.

The cerebellum also changes how it communicates with other brain regions during adolescence. [One study](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/24/9078) looked into this and found that 8% of connections demonstrated decreased structural connectivity, while 6% showed increased structural connectivity.

## Amygdala

The amygdala is a key structure in the brain's limbic system, playing a vital role in processing emotions, particularly fear and agression. It is also important in the processes of emotional memory formation social interactions and decision making linked to emotions.

One major change that occurs during adolescence is a surge of hormones (*such as estrogen and androgens/testostrone, a.k.a sex steroids*) that directly affects the amygdala, possibly leading to a heightened emotional response. Adolescents may feel emotions more intensely, both positive and negative, shown [here](https://www.bing.com/search?q=effects+of+estrogen+and+androgens+and+amygdala&FORM=AWRE). Eventually, as an individual reaches the late stage of adolescence, they start to modulate their emotional responses and regulate their behaviour in social and emotional contexts.

Adolescent development on the amygdala will see an increase in ***risk taking*** and sensation-seeking behaviour. The amygdala's role in processing reward-related stimuli and assessing potential risks contributes to adolescents' propensity for engaing in novel and sometimes risky behaviours. The [AACAP](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/The-Teen-Brain-Behavior-Problem-Solving-and-Decision-Making-095.aspx#:~:text=Pictures%20of%20the%20brain%20in%20action%20show%20that,and%20less%20by%20the%20thoughtful%2C%20logical%20frontal%20cortex.) explains that since adolescents' prefrontal cortex is still developing, their actions are guided more by the emotional and reactive amygdala.

The amygdala also explains why adolescents get more mood swings and have certain difficulty with conflict resolution.

Physically, the amygdala develops more axons and more white matter grows in it. The amygdala is also subject to synaptic pruning and myelination.

## Prefrontal Cortex

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a superstar of the brain, playing a critical role in those complex cognitive functions that set humans apart. Its main functions include executive functions such as planning, problem-solving, reasoning, and decision-making. It is also involved in working memory processes, such as maintaing information in mind while performing other mental operations, as well as inhibiting innappropriate or impulsive behaviours, directing and sustaining attention, regulating emotions and emotional responses, personality, planning/coordinating motor movements and higher cognitive functions (*essentially self-control and concentration*).

The PFC is largely formed by childhood and adolescence is when it undergoes [significant refinement](https://adolescentpsychology.pressbooks.sunycreate.cloud/chapter/brain-changes/). Its like a building under construction; the basic structure is there, but the finer details and internal wirings are still being worked on. Synaptic pruning and myelination also occur in the PFC. However, the PFC doesn't grow with the rest of the brain... It lags behind. This is why teens might excel at memorization (which mainly relies on the hippocampus) but struggle to plan and control their impulses. This explains why the amygdala is so dominant in adolescent years, since the PFC isn't fully developed yet, emotions can often hijack decision-making in teens, leading to impulsive behavior or risky choices. It is also known as the "personality center".

The prefrontal cortex, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), undergoes continued development during adolescence. This development is characterized by increases in gray matter volume, dendritic arborization, and synaptic density, contributing to improved cognitive abilities such as decision-making, impulse control, and planning.

## Corpus Callosum

The corpus callosum is responsible for acting as a crucial bridge between your left and right hemisphere. It is basically a highway of information, being made of the largest bundle of nerve fibres (*myelinated axons in their full form of nerves*) in the brain and consisting of mostly white matter. The corpus callosum facilitates communication, ensuring both hemispheres contribute to complex tasks.

During adolescence, the corpus callosum nonlinearly thickens. This growth is likely due to an increase in the amount of white matter and changes in its microstructural properties. [MRIs have proven this](https://adolescentpsychology.pressbooks.sunycreate.cloud/chapter/brain-changes/). Different portions of the corpus callosum (*e.g. the splenum*) tend to show greater growth compared to other regions during adolescence. Myelination and synpatic pruning still occur in this part of the brain. It has also been seen that as the  corpus callosum develops, stronger links also devlop between the hippocampus and frontal areas that set goals and weigh different agendas. This development is likely to underlie the maturation of cognitive skills and ablities druing the transiion to adulthood.

Studies have also investigated potential sex differences in corpus callosum development during adolescence. While findings have been somewhat inconsistent, some research suggests that males and females may exhibit differences in the rate and pattern of corpus callosum growth during this period. These differences may reflect underlying differences in brain organization and functional connectivity between males and females.

## Frontal Lobe

Being at the front of your brain and occupying about ⅓ of your cerebral hemisphere. It is known for intellectual processing, emotional information processing, aggression regulation, judgement and decision-making. It is primarily associated with higher cognitive functions and voluntary movement control. It encompasses several key areas responsible for essential aspects of human behavior and cognition. These include executive functions like planning, decision-making, problem-solving, and reasoning. Additionally, the frontal lobe houses the primary motor cortex, which controls voluntary muscle movements, and Broca's area, crucial for speech production.

Synaptic Pruning and Myelination obviously occurs, but there is also a gradual improvement in executive functions such as problem solving. The frontal lobe contributes to processes related to self-awareness and identity formation. Adolescents undergo significant changes in self-concept, values, and aspirations as they explore different roles and identities, influenced by both internal factors and external experiences.

Neurons (gray matter) and synapses (junctions between neurons) proliferate in the cerebral cortex and are then gradually pruned throughout adolescence. Eventually, more than 40% of all synapses are eliminated, largely in the frontal lobes.
